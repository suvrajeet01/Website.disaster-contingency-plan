Natural disasters can strike anyplace, anytime with little or no warning. Fortunately, a small
degree of preparation and common sense can greatly increase one's chances of surviving a natural
disaster.Disaster response and contingency planning leads to organizational
readiness in anticipation of an emergency.This includes management
of human and financial resources, availability of emergency supplies,
and communications procedures. Such planning can help mitigate the
destructive effects of a disaster by ensuring timely and effective
provision of humanitarian aid to those most in need. Time spent in
disaster response planning equals time saved when a disaster
occurs. Delays in providing services can result in needless suffering for
individuals and families affected by a disaster, and create additional
burdens for those responding. Effective disaster response planning
leads to timely and effective disaster relief operations. It also helps in
building realistic expectations.
