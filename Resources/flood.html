There are three main types of floods: river floods, flash floods, and coastal floods. River
floods are due to heavy rains and/or snowmelt in up-stream areas. Flash floods result from
isolated and localized intense rainstorms, dam failures, and breakups of ice jams. Coastal floods
are associated with tropical cyclones, tsunami waves, and storm surges. Depending on depth of
water, duration, velocity, rate of rise, frequency of occurrence, and season, floods can roll
boulders, tear out trees, wash away buildings and bridges, and carve out new channels. Lethal
waves can move at incredible speeds and exceed 2m in height.
Many floods are predictable by hours if caused by storm surges or rains accompanying
tropical storms. This allows time to move people, livestock and property to higher ground. Floods caused by intensive
rainfall in localized areas are more difficult to predict, though they are typically seasonal. 
Statistically, the largest numbers of casualties are children and the weak as a result of
drowning or injuries from collapsing buildings and floating debris. Slow flooding causes few
deaths or injuries, but has a higher incidence of snake-bites, malaria, diarrhea and viral
infections, lasting up to ten weeks following flooding. Floods can make water sources
inaccessible for days and cause losses of harvests and food stocks.
